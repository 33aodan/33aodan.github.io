# My personal page
created via my knowledge, stackoverflow, and 3school. Most of this stuff is boring, so don't read into it too much. Favicons was something I struggled the most with as I spent over a week trying to fix it. Page transition was something I learned about over the course of this project. Nothing much to say other than once I get a job I'll be buying "baodannguyen.com", as well as purchasing Github Team. Check out my other repositories as I learn and grow from my classes!
